What are the major factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin in the most recent 10-Q compared to the previous quarters?,*AAPL*,Multi-Doc RAG,Text,"In the most recent 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2023, the factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin compared to previous quarters include:

1. Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin.
2. Lower Products volume, which decreased gross margin.
3. Cost savings and a different Products mix, which partially offset the decrease in gross margin.

For the third quarter of 2023, the Products gross margin percentage increased compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, despite the negative impact of foreign currency weakness and decreased leverage. However, the year-over-year Products gross margin percentage for the first nine months of 2023 decreased due to the weakness in foreign currencies and decreased leverage, despite cost savings and a different Products mix.

The Services gross margin increased due to higher Services net sales but was partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies and higher Services costs. The Services gross margin percentage decreased due to higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.

Examine how Intel's effective tax rate in the most recent 10-Q compares with the tax-related discussions in the notes section.,*2023 Q3 INTC*,Single-Doc Multi-Chunk RAG,Table,"Intel's effective tax rate for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, was 696.2%, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, it was 642.0%. This information is found in Note 7: Income Taxes, which states that the provision for (benefit from) taxes was $(362) million on income (loss) before taxes of $(52) million for the third quarter, and $(1,041) million on income (loss) before taxes of $(2,026) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The notes section further explains that the provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim period is typically determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. However, for the first nine months of 2023, Intel used the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period because they were unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions.
