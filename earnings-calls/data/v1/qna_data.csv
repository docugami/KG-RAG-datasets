"As of Q1 2023, what business investments does Snowflake believe will set up the business for the next 10-20 years?","""And we're going to continue to invest in our business. But as I mentioned, we've done this all the time where we make ecient investments.
There is no waste in Snowake. There never has been in the last 2.5 years, and it won't be going forward. But there's a great opportunity in front of us. We're continuing to invest very heavily in R&D, and we're investing very heavily in the go-to- market function. And we will continue to do that, but we're going to do it eciently and continue to show leverage in our model. And we're very focused on free cash ow.
We're also in the envious position that we're sitting on over $5 billion today, and we will be opportunistic because we're doing this for the long term, not for the next 2 quarters or 3 quarters or however long this macro uncertainty is going to last, but we're going to set ourselves up for the next 10, 20 years.""

Source: Q1 2023 Earnings Call"
"Based on free cash flow for Q1 2023, how does the anticipated 2023 full year cash flow compare to previous year's cash flow?","""Well, I'd say, I think we were probably overly conservative last year. We just -- as a reminder, we just did 43% free cash flow this recent quarter, which is skewed, but I feel very good about 16%-plus for the full year this year. And as I mentioned, we're going to continue to show leverage every year, and I'm not -- collecting cash from our customers is not an issue.""

Source: Q1 2023 Earnings Call"
Are there any public sector opportunities that Snowflake anticipates investing in as of 2023?,"""Our opportunity is incredibly broad-based. I mean there's still verticals where we're not very well penetrated as well. For example, the public sector, especially federal government. I shouldn't say there are parts of the federal -- the public sector where we're doing quite well, where we are making investments because over the long haul, we really plan to have a very, very large business in those sectors. But that's not something you sort of turn on and off on a dime. Once you're on an investment process there, you've got to -- you have to stick with it.""

Source: Q1 2023 Earnings Call"
"As of Q1 2023, what are customer consumption trends within their contract periods?","""Yes. So just to be clear, we still are seeing our customers consume their contracted amount well within their contract period. Actually, one of our largest customers who signed a 3-year $100 million deal, we've already invoiced them for their third year when we're still in the second year. And I don't see that changing for our customers because most of our customers have, historically, and I still see that happening, consuming within their contract period. I just don't see that changing right now.""

Source: Q1 2023 Earnings Call"
What are Snowflake's CFO's expectations for their net revenue rate as of Q1 2023?,"""As I said in the past, I don't expect the net revenue retention to stay at this extremely high rate. I do think it will come down over time. It will come down gradually over time, but I don't see it increasing. And I mentioned that last quarter. And I do think that will continue to come down, but it will remain well above 130% for a very long time.""

Source: Q1 2023 Earnings Call"
Summarize Snowflake's response to whether their is overlap between the $1 million customers and the Fortune 500 base,"""I mean, we are -- we have footprint, but we're very marginally penetrated, which is great. That's exactly what we look for. We typically -- when we started out with customers, whether it's Fortune 500 or otherwise, it's whole process that spans a long period of time. It's a journey. It's a relationship that you're going their legacy workows, their new projects and then it's something that grows and grows and grows. And you very clearly see that in our net revenue retention rates, that people are literally evolving and learning and expanding as they go along. They may not have a very clear view of what they will be doing when, but they're literally learning and exploring as they go along.
The other thing that I would say is that we shouldn't sort of view things in the historical way that all the money is going to come from Fortune 500 companies. That is absolutely not the case. I mean you'd be stunned if you look at the number of customers who are not Fortune 500 and how high the revenue contribution is. And that's because these are newer enterprises, they are more in the cloud, digital direct-to-consumer oriented, and they have a very different culture towards data and a very different orientation. They will denitely feature very, very prominently in our business mix. It doesn't mean that Fortune 500 isn't important. It obviously is. But their adoption as traditional enterprises is often not as fast as the newer entities that we're dealing with.""

"In the Q3 2021 earnings call, why does Snowflake not have to prioritize its own products?","So we're not going to be a company where we have our own flavor of everything and our partners are all going to be secondary. We want to actively encourage development on our platform, participation on our platform because, again, we're a consumption company. So the way we drive our strategy is to drive activity on our platform, right? I mean if we get activity on our platform, whether our product drives it or a partner drives it, it yields the same result, right? So we'd be crazy to -- because the way our model works, we don't have to prioritize our own products.

"In 2022, what factor was impacting slow adoption in the public sector?",Restrictions that are part of the Federal government. 
"As of 2022, how was existing the infrastructure of the public sector impacting slow adoption?","""Well, I mean there are verticals like, for example, I mean, we talked about this on previous calls, the contribution we're getting from public sector is not where we think it will eventually be under real structural reasons, why that is so. And we're solving for those issues, and that business will come along. But there is a lot of friction. I mean we're dealing with infrastructure that has existed for a very long period of time, is completely grafted into operational processes.
You don't just unplug that stuff and plug something in and you're off to the races, right? These are generational shifts and transitions that enterprises are taking. So it's not like throwing a switch, these are very, very carefully orchestrated transitions over a long period of time. It takes a lot of resources. It takes a lot of people""

Source: Q3 2022 Earnings Call"
"As of 2022, how did going through marketplace impact RPO?","""So some customers choose to go through marketplace. Others choose to go direct. They generally choose to go to marketplace so they can draw down their commit with the cloud provider, that would still show up in RPO because we still get the contract from the customer. We just do the invoicing and everything through marketplace for them.""

Source: Q3 2022 Earnings Call"
"As of 2022, how does Snowflake's business model allow customers to see value without having to be concerned about the cost of consumption?","""One of the great things about running a consumption model is that we charge back who is spending the compute, which business unit. So business units can decide where they want to run those workloads, how often they want to run it, how they want to provision it. So they're really in charge. It's not sort of a runaway utility model. People can selectively decide which workloads they want to run and what is the business case for it. And that's the way it's supposed to work.
That really mitigates the sticker shock. If people can make investment decisions as they go along and as who owns it. We're seeing with some of our large banking customers, they went from recomputing loan rates on a monthly basis. They're doing it every night. Well, they had a business case for it. Does it cost money? Yes, it costs money.

Source: Q1 2022 Earnings Call"
What are Snowflake's minimum qualifications for something to be considered an edge?,"""..for us to designate something as an
edge, it has to have a minimal amount of time in terms of durable consumption. So there's very much a consumption
dimension to these edges that we track and mods or otherwise, we don't consider it an edge in our world. In other words, they have to be durable and stable because a lot of data relationships are transient. They exist for a period of time. They exist for a project, maybe a trial, whatever it is. But that's not -- that's also a metric that we follow where we really look for, what we'd call, stable or durable edges.""

Source: Q1 2022 Earnings Call"
"For customers landed in Q4 2021, what impact did they have on revenue in Q1 2022?","""Well, these large accounts are very, very long sales cycles, and you are going to see lumpiness in the additions. Obviously,
Q4 was a strong quarter. And as one would expect, that's just landing a customer. That doesn't mean it contributed to revenue. As I said, most of those Fortune 500, we landed in Q4. We've seen virtually no revenue from them yet today. I can't stress that enough.""

always been to pass that on to customers.""

Source: Q1 2022 Earnings Call"
How has storage compression impacted Snowflake's margins?,"""Well, what I will say is it does improve margins. And the way it improves margin is because storage becomes more
efficient. Storage is a smaller component of the overall mix of the revenue, and compute is the real value of our software
