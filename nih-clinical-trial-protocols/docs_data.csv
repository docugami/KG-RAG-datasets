NCT06155006,Adult Screening for Hepatitis c and Linkage to Treatment in Hospitals in Colombia,"Introduction: Hepatitis C virus infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. The risk of developing cirrhosis for people with chronic infection with the virus ranges from 15% to 30% over a 20-year period. According to 2019 data from the World Health Organization there are 58 million people living with chronic hepatitis C infection. Three-quarters of those infected live in low- to middle-income countries, some of which lack budgets for screening, diagnosis and treatment campaigns. While good progress has been made in several countries, a significant gap in testing and treatment remains. Barriers to timely diagnosis include lack of awareness on the part of health professionals, availability and access to screening tests. Simplifying the cascade of care for this pathology would help ensure that more patients remain involved in the care pathway and ultimately achieve global goals.

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in patients with risk factors for hepatitis C virus captured by opportunity screening in the included hospital institutions.

Methodology: Descriptive multicenter cross-sectional study. A total of 27160 participants among the seven institutions, 3880 per institution. Includes all persons over 18 years of age attended in the included health service provider institutions (IPS) who are users of hospitalization, emergency, outpatient and any other hospital care services. Application of a questionnaire to identify the inclusion criteria and data collection, signature of informed consent, sample collection by rapid test Abbott HCV rapid test - BIOLINE HCV and evaluation by tele-consultation by hepatologist principal investigator who will guide you to access the confirmatory test for HCV (viral load for Hepatitis C), the study will assume responsibility for its realization.",Hepatitis C Virus Infection,"Prevalence, Hepatitis C virus prevalence, 12 months","Opportunity for treatment, Access to treatment for hepatitis C virus infection, 12 months",2023-12-11,"Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/06/NCT06155006/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

NCT06152367,Immunization With Autologous Dendritic Cells and Tumor Lysates in Melanoma Patients,"Implementing this protocol has its ethical justification in that patients with metastatic melanoma, once tumor invasion has reached beyond the lymph node barrier, cannot possibly be treated satisfactorily with traditional surgery methods, radiotherapy, or conventional available chemotherapy. The disseminated tumor is refractory to all standard treatments. Almost 100% of patients who develop distant metastases will die from their disease, either from complications or cachexia. Therefore, immunotherapy based on immunological stimulation with immunocompetent dendritic cells, added to immunological reinforcement with IL-2, can, according to the evidence emanating from ongoing clinical protocols, produce a prolongation of survival with better quality and, in some cases, with partial or total regression of the tumor.

General objective: It is to study the clinical and immunological response of patients treated with vaccines based on autologous dendritic cells loaded with tumor antigens, derived from allogeneic melanoma extracts, in combination or not, with intercalated low doses of recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL2) PROLEUKIN ® (aldesleukin).

NCT06159946,Access-H20 Faucet for Spinal Cord Injury,"The Phase I SBIR objective is to design, develop \& demonstrate feasibility of Access-H2OTM, a sensor driven smart faucet to enable and empower independent drinking and grooming for individuals impacted by spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI severely impacts functional independence \& ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Greater function is typically lost with higher, more complete injuries. More specifically, those impacted above C5-C7 have impaired upper extremities, which limits the use of arms and hands for activities such as eating, drinking, and grooming. Functional access to water for these individuals becomes a key to increased independence and successful completion of ADLs. Therefore, commercialization of smart fountain faucets, which can automatically deliver water in target temperature, force, \& nozzle setting for a specific ADL, has the potential to empower individuals with SCI for greater independence \& and improved quality of life.

NCT06145646,Intramuscular Temperature on the Echo-textural Characteristics,"Echointensity and echotexture have been used as a physiological marker for changes in skeletal muscle quality and structure caused by physical training, low activity, ageing and some neuromuscular disorders. However, there are some influencing factors on muscle echo-intensity and echotexture, such as temperature, which may not be taken into account when performing an ultrasound assessment and may alter the results.

This study aims to investigate the effects of muscle temperature on echointensity and other 2nd order echotextures variables such as homogeneity, contrast, correlation and entropy of muscle tissue, in order to gain a better understanding of this correlation and minimise its influence, which would allow greater precision in the use of muscle ultrasound as a diagnostic tool.

The methodology of this study includes firstly the acquisition of ultrasound images of the vastus lateralis muscle. This acquisition will be performed during the continuous recording of muscle temperature, carried out during a passive cooling process after 20 min of heating using microwave equipment.

NCT06149832,Treatment of Oral Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease With Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell Dressing,"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a clinicopathological syndrome caused by donor lymphocytes attacking the recipient's organs during the process of reestablishing donor immunity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), with an incidence of about 30%-70%. The clinical manifestations of cGVHD are varied, the course of the disease is prolonged, and the quality of life of patients is affected, and the long-term survival is affected. Among them, oral cGVHD is the most common type, which mainly presents with lichen planus, oral ulcers, mucosal atrophy, erythema and pain. At present, the treatment of oral cGVHD is based on systemic treatment and local hormone-containing gargling solution and local photochemotherapy. The former is easy to be complicated by oral local fungal infection, while the latter has no such equipment in China. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a simple, effective and low-toxicity local treatment for oral cGVHD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most widely used cell products in clinic. The combination of MSCS and hematopoietic stem cells can improve the success rate of transplantation and accelerate hematopoietic reconstruction. The applicant team previously completed a national multi-center clinical study on MSCs prevention of cGVHD, which proved that sequential infusion of MSCs can effectively reduce the incidence of cGVHD, and the mechanism is that MSCs regulate Th1: Th2 balance and promote the differentiation of T cells to Th1 direction. Our previous mechanism study provides an important theoretical basis for MSCs treatment of oral cGVHD. According to the clinical needs and the rich experience of our research group in the field of MSCs clinical research, we plan to use dressing containing MSCs for the local treatment of oral cGVHD, so as to improve the lesion degree of oral cGVHD and improve the quality of life of allo-HSCT patients, and provide clinical experience for reference for the local treatment of MSCs graft-versus-host disease.",Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"Oral cGVHD improves condition, Oral cGVHD score, after 2 weeks of treatment",,2023-11-30,"Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/32/NCT06149832/Prot_000.pdf"

These scores are then aggregated to generate two summary scores: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). The resulting scores are norm-based, comparing an individual's health status to population norms. Health related quality of life is calculate as the summary of PCS and MCS.
